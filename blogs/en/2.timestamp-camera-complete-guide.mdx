# Complete Guide to Timestamp Camera: From Basic Features to Advanced Applications

Have you ever needed to add precise time information to photos but struggled to find the right tool? In scenarios like attendance tracking, legal evidence collection, and construction supervision, a photo with accurate timestamps often speaks louder than words. This article will provide an in-depth analysis of the core technical features of timestamp cameras, from basic millisecond-level time watermarks to advanced GPS positioning and custom signature systems, offering you a comprehensive usage guide. If you're looking for a professional [timestamp camera tool](https://www.timestampcameras.com), this article will introduce you to its powerful features in detail.

## Core Feature Analysis of Timestamp Cameras

### Millisecond-Level Time Watermark System

The core advantage of timestamp cameras lies in their **millisecond-level precision** time watermark functionality. Unlike traditional cameras that can only record time information to the second level, modern timestamp cameras support 64 different time formats, from simple "HH:mm" to complex "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS" formats, meeting the precise requirements of different scenarios.

**Technical Implementation Points:**
- Support for 12-hour and 24-hour display formats
- Millisecond-level precision (.SSS format)
- Multiple date formats: YYYY/MM/DD, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.
- Internationalization support: Chinese, English, Japanese time formats
- Real-time automatic update functionality, ensuring time accuracy
